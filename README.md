# Good README Generator

## Description ##

This generator is able to produce a good README by asking the user a series of questions regarding their project using the command line in the terminal and Node.js. After the user finishes all questions, a nice, professional README is created for them to use. This easy-to-use generator allows the user to spend less time writing a good README and more time on the actual project.
