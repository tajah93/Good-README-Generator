# Good README Generator

## Description ##

This generator is able to produce a good README by asking the user a series of questions regarding their project using the command line in the terminal and Node.js. After the user finishes all questions, a nice, professional README is created for them to use. This easy-to-use generate allows the user to spend less time on writing a good README and more time on the actual project. 

## Installation ##

> npm init\
> npm install inquirer

## Usage ##

The [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) must be installed before accessing the generator's functionality. 

The following command will begin the README writing process:

A series of questions related to your project development must be answered before the README is generated.
